# Kadi4Mat Test

This notebook contains code to upload some example data to the Kadi4Mat demo instance https://demo-kadi4mat.iam-cms.kit.edu/.

The Tribology example files can be downloaded here: https://zenodo.org/record/6797703.

To run the notebook, create a `.env` file with a variable `ACCESS_TOKEN=...`. You can generate an access token in the Kadi4Mat > User > Settings > Access Tokens.

Note: Not all the files will be uploaded as there is a 25 MB limit on the demo instance.
